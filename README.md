# RoomManager service

## Business problem
Two companies, COKE and PEPSI, are sharing an office building but as they are competitors, they donâ€™t trust each other. Tomorrow is COLA day (for one day), that the two companies are celebrating. They are gathering a number of business partners in the building. In order to optimize space utilization, they have decided to set-up a joint booking system where any user can book one of the 20 meeting rooms available, 10 from each company **(C01, C02, ..., C10 and P01, P02, ...., P10)**.

The booking system has the following functionalities:

- Users can see meeting rooms availability
- Users can book meeting rooms by the hour (first come first served)
- Users can cancel their own reservations

## Config
Service's configuration example is in the file: **./config/example-config.ini**

**NOTE:** For now it contains configuration **secrets** that **must not be used** in production and should be changed to loading secrets from external secure storage like Hashicorp Vault.

To run the service locally, create a copy of **example-config.ini** and rename it to **config.ini**

## Run
To run the system you need to run the following command: `make run`
It will spin up the docker containers of a Database (MySQL) and a RoomManager service.

To access the database, you can use address: `localhost:3306`
To access the service API, send HTTP requests to the address: `localhost:8081`

To debug from IDE, you can run DB container alone by run command: `make run-deps`

Stop all the fun: `make stop`

## Initial DB data
After the very first run of the Database, a manual operation of "migration applying" is required.
Using any database/sql client, apply scripts from files: **db/migration/0/1_schema.sql** and **db/migration/0/1_schema.sql**
MySQL container will bind the local **./test/db/** folder to save all data, so you can stop the system at any time - the data will persist.

## API
The base path for the API v1 supported is: **http://localhost:8081/api/v1**
The next listed endpoints supported atm.:
- **GET /rooms** - returns a list of all rooms registered in the system
- **GET /rooms/<roomID>** - returns a room by ID
- **GET /rooms/:roomID/reservations** - returns all reservations of the **roomID** specified
- **GET /rooms/:roomId/reservations/:rsrvID** - returns a room reservation by ID
- **POST /rooms/-/reservations** - creates a new reservation getting all the information required from the POST body of JSON view:
    ```
    {
        "user_token": 3,
        "room_id": 1,
        "start_time": "2022-02-17T08:00:00Z"
    }
    ```
- **DELETE /rooms/-/reservations/:rsrvID** - marks reservation as deleted using its ID and userID that created the reservation. The body is JSON of view:
    ```
    {
        "user_token": 3
    }
    ```

**NOTE:** Examples of tha API usage are in Postman collection file: **test/postman/RoomService.postman_collection.json**
